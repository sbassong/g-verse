## **_Local Environment Requirements_**
Node, npm, and PostgreSQL are necessary to run this application. If needed, please follow the installation guidelines **[below](#env-requirements)**



## **_Getting Started_**
 Once the requirements are met, we're ready to run the application. Follow the steps below to set up and launch the application server.

Copy this repo's HTTPS URL and clone it onto your local machine's terminal:
  ```sh 
  git clone https://github.com/sbassong/g-verse.git
  ```

  #### *From here you will need to have 2 terminals open to run both the frontend and backend*
  ### A. Client / React app / Frontend
  1. Change directory into the newly cloned folder's client folder then install dependencies
      ```sh 
      cd g-verse/client
      npm install
      ```
  1. Run the app on port 3000 
      ```sh 
      npm start
      ```

  ### B. Server + Database / Express app / Backend
  1. Change directory into the newly cloned folder then install dependencies
      ```sh 
      cd g-verse
      npm install
      ```
1.  In the g-verse root folder, add a `.env` file containing **both** the following variables 
      ```sh 
      SALT_ROUNDS=<12 or 16>
      APP_SECRET=<WhateverCombinationOfCharactersYouWant.Add889aAndSpecialChars&&##!Throughout>
      ```


1.  Use the sequelize-cli to create the `g-verse_development` database on postgres (databases have a different name based on environment. Can be found in `config/config.json`).

    *PostgreSQL needs to be running from here on out*

    ```sh 
    sequelize db:create
    ```
1.  Migrate the database with app's models
    ```sh 
    sequelize db:migrate
    ```
1.  *Recommended*: Run the following to seed the database with some initial games. (already set up in the `seeders/20210924141036-games` file)

    *Feel free to modify the game objects or add your own, following the Game model guidelines*

    ```sh 
    sequelize db:seed:all
    ```
1.  Finally, run the server on port 3001
    ```sh 
    npm run dev 
    ```

        To start Postgres and keep it running on your machine

            brew services start postgresql

        To test the above, create a database with your local profile/account name

            createdb <account name>
